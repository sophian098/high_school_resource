    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      The inspiration behind creating this app stemmed from the desire to adress
      the challenges that students often face when seeking educational resources
      online. Our team recognized that many existing apps and platforms require
      costly subscriptions making essential study materials and assistance
      inaccessible to a significant portion of students. This realization,
      coupled with our commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible
      learning environment, inspired us to create our resource hub. <br /><br />
      Moreover, we identified a specific need for assistance for those
      transitioning into univeristy life. The initial stages of university can
      be overwhelming, with students often feeling lost and uncertain about
      where to find reliable informtion and guidance. We wanted to bridge this
      gap by offering a comprehensive set of tools ad tips to ease this
      transition.
    </p>
<br>
    <h2>What it does</h2>
    <p>
      The HSR hub is like a helpful friend for students. It has lots of free
      resources to make learning easier. You can find study materials without
      having to pay for anything. We know starting university can be confusing,
      so we also give tips to make that easier. Our app is all about making
      education accessible and helping students succeed, especially if they're
      just starting out or don't have much money to spend.
